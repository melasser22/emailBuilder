## ðŸ“¦ Using the Editor as a Local NPM Package

You can build and use the EmailBuilder.js editor as a local npm package in your own React projects. Follow these steps:

---

### 1. Build and Pack the Editor

Open your terminal and run:

```sh
cd packages/editor-sample
npm install
npm run build
npm pack
```

This will generate a file like `email-builder-js-editor-1.0.0.tgz` in the `packages/editor-sample` directory.

---

### 2. Install the Package in Your Project

Copy the `.tgz` file to your other project's root directory, then run:

```sh
npm install ./email-builder-js-editor-1.0.0.tgz
```

---

### 3. Install Peer Dependencies

Make sure your project also has these installed:

```sh
npm install react react-dom @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @fontsource/roboto
```

---

### 4. Usage Example

#### **main.tsx / main.jsx**

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme, CssBaseline } from "@mui/material";
import { CacheProvider } from "@emotion/react";
import createCache from "@emotion/cache";

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: { mode: "light" }, // or "dark"
});
const cache = createCache({ key: "css", prepend: true });

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <CacheProvider value={cache}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <CssBaseline />
        <App />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </CacheProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

#### **App.tsx**

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Editor from "email-builder-js-editor"; // or "@usewaypoint/editor-sample" if published as such
import "@fontsource/roboto/300.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/400.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/500.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/700.css";

// Define your document type
export type TEditorDocument = {
  root: {
    type: string;
    data: {
      backdropColor: string;
      canvasColor: string;
      textColor: string;
      fontFamily: string;
    };
    childrenIds: string[];
  };
};

// Example default document
const defaultDoc: TEditorDocument = {
  root: {
    type: "EmailLayout",
    data: {
      backdropColor: "#fff",
      canvasColor: "#fff",
      textColor: "#000",
      fontFamily: "MODERN_SANS",
    },
    childrenIds: [],
  },
};

export default function App() {
  const [doc, setDoc] = useState(defaultDoc);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 16, height: "100vh" }}>
      <Editor
        document={doc}
        rootBlockId="root"
        onChange={(updated) => setDoc(updated)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Tips**
- You can customize the initial document, theme, and layout as needed.
- Make sure to use the correct import path for your package name.
- For advanced usage (custom send logic, templates, etc.), see the main documentation or source code.

Now you can use the EmailBuilder.js editor in your own React projects with full control and local development support!

## Introduction

EmailBuilder.js is a free and open-source email template builder for developers. Build emails faster than ever with clean JSON or HTML output that render well across clients and devices.

[Use our playground](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder) or learn more about how to [get started using EmailBuilder.js](#using-emailbuilderjs).

<br>

## Build simple welcome emails to complex reports

Use a no-code builder that is flexible enough to create a wide variety of template designs â€“ from simple welcome emails to complex reports.

![Image of example templates](images/template.png)

Sample templates available in the playground:

- [Welcome email](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/welcome)
- [One-time passcode (OTP)](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/one-time-password)
- [Reset password](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reset-password)
- [E-commerce receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/order-ecomerce)
- [SaaS subscription receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/subscription-receipt)
- [Reservation reminder](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder)
- [Post metrics](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/post-metrics-report)
- [Respond to inquiry](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/respond-to-message)

<br>

## Why?

It's finally time to stop using 90's style HTML and CSS to build product emails. EmailBuilder.js takes inspiration from [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) and email component libraries and puts them into an easy to use no-code builder to that allow the entire team to build emails.

Since the builder is completely free and open source, teams can self-host the builder and extend as needed.

<br>

## Built-in blocks

Each block is it's own npm package that can be included in the builder. These are the ones that are built-in:

- [Avatar](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-avatar)
- [Button](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-button)
- [Columns](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-columns-container)
- [Container](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-container)
- [Divider](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-divider)
- [Heading](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-heading)
- [HTML](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-html)
- [Image](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-image)
- [Spacer](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-spacer)
- [Container](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-text)

<br>

## Email client support

All blocks are [tested and supported](https://www.usewaypoint.com/docs/email-client-support) by modern email clients (on both desktop and mobile) including: Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY and Superhuman.

## Email builder output

The email builder can output to a clean JSON or raw HTML. You can see this from the playground by simply clicking on the HTML or JSON tabs in the builder.

![Image of JSON in builder](images/output.png)

<br>

## Using EmailBuilder.js

Install the package in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @usewaypoint/email-builder
```

Given an EmailBuilder.js configuration (the JSON output of the builder):

```javascript
import { TReaderDocument } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {
  root: {
    type: 'EmailLayout',
    data: {
      backdropColor: '#F8F8F8',
      canvasColor: '#FFFFFF',
      textColor: '#242424',
      fontFamily: 'MODERN_SANS',
      childrenIds: ['block-1709578146127'],
    },
  },
  'block-1709578146127': {
    type: 'Text',
    data: {
      style: {
        fontWeight: 'normal',
        padding: {
          top: 16,
          bottom: 16,
          right: 24,
          left: 24,
        },
      },
      props: {
        text: 'Hello world',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

You can render the EmailBuilder.js configuration to an HTML email string:

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

const string = renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' });
```

Or you can render the EmailBuilder.js configuration by using the `<Reader />` React component:

```javascript
import { Reader } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

<Reader document={CONFIGURATION} rootBlockId="root" />;
```

<br>

## Sending emails

In most cases, you'll want to take the EmailBuilder.js configuration, render it to HTML, and then send it as an email. Here are a couple of examples on how you can do this using the same configuration from the examples above.

<br>

### Sending through nodemailer

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

// Replace this with your transport configuration
const transportConfig = {}
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(transportConfig);

// Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {}

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: 'no-reply@example.com'
  to: 'friend@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello',
  html: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
});
```

<br>

### Sending through an email API

We'll use [Waypoint](https://www.usewaypoint.com) for this example, however, you can use any email API like Amazon SES, SendGrid, or MailGun.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

// Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {}

await axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://live.waypointapi.com/v1/email_messages',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  auth: {
    username: API_KEY_USERNAME,
    password: API_KEY_PASSWORD,
  },

  data: {
    from: 'no-reply@example.com'
    to: 'friend@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    bodyHtml: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
  },
});
```
